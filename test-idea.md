This is a comment. It doesn't show up in the rendered file, just the raw markdown.

You can invent whatever tags you want. The 'lightgrey' color will be replaced with a randomly selected color
(consistent across tags with the same name) when the repository builds itself.

Just write your idea in normal markdown.
